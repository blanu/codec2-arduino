# codec2-arduino

This is a proof-of-concept for using the [Codec2 audio codec library](http://www.rowetel.com/?page_id=452) on the Arduino-compatible [Adafruit Feather nRF52 Bluefruit LE board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406). The nRF52 contains a Cortex M4F processor, which is the same one used in the [SM1000](http://www.rowetel.com/?page_id=3902). The SM1000 is a device that encodes and decodes Codec2 audio. It is meant to be used in conjunction with a radio to send and receive voice communications.

Now that Adafruit is providing a convenient Arduino-compatible board with the same processor, I wanted to see if I could get Codec2 to compile inside of the Arduino IDE. It worked!

## Getting Started

This is just a proof-of-concept. It contains the following components:

1. Codec2 source - all of the .h and .c files are included here. The build system is not used.
2. Pre-generated codebooks - taken from a previous build of Codec2
3. libsamplerate - Required by Codec2. All of the .h and .c files are included here
4. codec2-arduino.ino - A sample application

Simply open the codec2-arduino.ino sketch in the Arduino IDE and hit the compile button. This will compile all of the files, including Codec2 and libsamplerate.

### Prerequisites

You will need an [Adafruit Feather nRF52 Bluefruit LE board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406).
The current demo also requires a [Adalogger FeatherWing - RTC + SD Add-on](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2922) and an SD card.

You will also need a USB micro-B cable to program the nRF52 board and some way to write to the SD card from your computer.

### Installing

Format the SD card to use FAT32.
For testing, you will need a Codec2 file using mode 700B. Place this on the SD card in the root directory and name is TEST700B.C2 and place the SD card in the Adalogger.

Follow the [Adafruit tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide) to get your nRF52 board set up.

Open the codec2-arduino.ino sketch in the Arduino IDE.
Connect the USB micro-B cable to the nRF52 board and hit the Upload button.

## Testing

Click the Serial Monitor button in the Arduino IDE.
If all is going well, you should see lots of unreadable gibberish on your screen.
Congratulations, this is successfully decoded audio!

## Contributing

This is just a proof of concept. What should happen with this is that the libsamplerate and codec2 parts are turned into Arduino packages. If you would be interested in working on that, let me know.
